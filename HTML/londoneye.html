<p>The London Eye is a ferris wheel located at Westminster Bridge in London. The wheel is 135 meters above the ground at its highest point. The London Eye was opened in January 2000 and was awarded the largest ferris wheel in the world. The farris wheel consists of 32 glass gondolas and accommodates 25 people per glass gondola. The Ferris wheel can carry 800 passengers at a time. The lap time is about 30 minutes. David Marks and Julia Barfied are the architects behind the famous London Eye.</p>
<p>With the London Eye you can get a fantastic view of the city. It's a great way to see London from above, especially at night when the city is lit up.</p>
