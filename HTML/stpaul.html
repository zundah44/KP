<h1> St. Pauls Cathedral</h1>
<p>St. Paul's cathedral is considered the fifth building in London. It burned down in the town fire of 1666 and was rebuilt in 1710. The cathedral is 111 meters high and 34 meters wide. There are several reasons why St. Paul's Cathedral is famous. It was designed by Sir Christopher Wren and has historical significance. The cathedral survived the bombings in the Second World War and was the cathedral in which Charles and Diana got married.</p>
